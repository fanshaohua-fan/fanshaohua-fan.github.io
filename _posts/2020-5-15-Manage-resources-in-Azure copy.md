### Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Compare each cloud computing deployment model (public, private, and hybrid).
- Understand the advantages of each cloud computing service model.
- Decide which deployment and service model you should use for your services.

There are three deployment models for cloud computing: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud. The following illustration shows an overview of these deployment models.

### Cloud service models

Cloud computing resources are delivered using three different service models.

- **Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)** provides instant computing infrastructure that you can provision and manage over the Internet.
- **Platform as a service (PaaS)** provides ready-made development and deployment environments that you can use to deliver your own cloud services.
- **Software as a service (SaaS)** delivers applications over the Internet as a web-based service.
