[Container services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/containers/)

Save costs by lifting and shifting your existing applications to containers, and build microservices applications to deliver value to your users faster. Use end-to-end developer and CI/CD tools to develop, update, and deploy your containerized applications. Manage containers at scale with a fully managed Kubernetes container orchestration service that integrates with Azure Active Directory. Wherever you are in your app modernization journey, accelerate your containerized application development while meeting your security requirements.
