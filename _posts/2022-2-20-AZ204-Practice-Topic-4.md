User flows


- Retention - how many users come back?

- Users tool: How many people used your app and its features. Users are counted by using anonymous IDs stored in browser cookies. A single person using different browsers or machines will be counted as more than one user.

- Sessions tool: How many sessions of user activity have included certain pages and features of your app. A session is counted after half an hour of user inactivity, or after 24 hours of continuous use.

- Events tool: How often certain pages and features of your app are used. A page view is counted when a browser loads a page from your app, provided you've instrumented it.

- Funnel: If your application involves multiple stages, you need to know if most customers are progressing through the entire process, or if they're ending the process at some point. The progression through a series of steps in a web application is known as a funnel

- User flows: 

- - How do users navigate away from a page on your site?
- - What do users click on a page on your site?
- - Where are the places that users churn most from your site?
- - Are there places where users repeat the same action over and over?
