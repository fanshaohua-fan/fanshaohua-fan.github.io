## Develop for Azure Cache for Redis

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain the key scenarios Azure Cache for Redis covers and its service tiers.
- Identify the key parameters for creating an Azure Cache for Redis instance and interact with the cache.
- Connect an app to Azure Cache for Redis by using .NET Core.

**Key scenarios**

 - Data cache: cache aside
 - Content cache: header/footer/banner
 - Session store: shopping carts
 - Job and message queuing
 - Distributed transactions: Applications sometimes require a series of commands against a backend data-store to execute as a single atomic operation. All commands must succeed, or all must be rolled back to the initial state.

 
Accessing the Redis instance

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ping` | Ping the server. Returns "PONG". |
| `set [key] [value]` | Sets a key/value in the cache. Returns "OK" on success. |
| `get [key]` | Gets a value from the cache. |
| `exists [key]` | Returns '1' if the **key** exists in the cache, '0' if it doesn't. |
| `type [key]` | Returns the type associated to the value for the given **key**. |
| `incr [key]` | Increment the given value associated with **key** by '1'. The value must be an integer or double value. This returns the new value. |
| `incrby [key] [amount]` | Increment the given value associated with **key** by the specified amount. The value must be an integer or double value. This returns the new value. |
| `del [key]` | Deletes the value associated with the **key**. |
| `flushdb` | Delete *all* keys and values in the database. |
