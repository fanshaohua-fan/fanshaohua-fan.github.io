You are a developer for a software as a service (SaaS) company that uses an Azure Function to process orders. The Azure Function currently runs on an Azure
Function app that is triggered by an Azure Storage queue.
You are preparing to migrate the Azure Function to Kubernetes using Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA).
You need to configure Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) for the Azure Function.
Which CRDs should you configure?

You develop a software as a service (SaaS) offering to manage photographs. Users upload photos to a web service which then stores the photos in Azure
Storage Blob storage. The storage account type is General-purpose V2.
When photos are uploaded, they must be processed to produce and save a mobile-friendly version of the image. The process to produce a mobile-friendly version of the image must start in **less than one minute**.
You need to design the process that starts the photo processing.
Solution: Trigger the photo processing from Blob storage events.
