**YES**

Always have a clear view through your windscreen and front side windows. In addition, as a driver, you must have sufficient visibility into the road section next to you and behind you. You can create this with both exterior mirrors. Of course, it is wiser to de-ice the rear window, but it is not forbidden to drive.
